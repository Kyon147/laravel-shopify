# Funding

Information, guidelines, and FAQs, on sponsorship and donations for this repository.

## Introduction

Several individuals have contacted myself (@osiset) on opening up this repository for sponsorship or donations to support ongoing development. A range of reasons have been given from the individuals; such as: their work has utilized the package for clients, the package has saved them time and money, it's assisted them in learning Laravel development/testing much better, and so on.

Personally, I have been opposed to opening up sponsorship or donations in the past because I've seen other repositories implement it, and end up regretting it because the community would expect things such as daily commits, or issues to be resolved same-day, etc. However, in talking to some individuals recently, it appears this is not the case, so I am now opening it up.

## Value

Most developers in the open source world are bogged down by full time jobs, family life, and of course one's own personal life. Working and maintaining open source projects means the developer has to sacrifice personal time... either very early mornings, evenings/weekends after work, or late at night.

It's often hard for developers to explain to their non-techy family why they need to sit in front of a computer at those odd hours, to work on "free" projects.

Sponsorship and donations not only help ease that conversation, but it also gives a nice "thank you" to the developers, just like buying them a cup of coffee or frosty mug of beer. It also gives confidence that what's being developed is helping others in a meaningful way.

## Use of Funds

Any donations received will be a great thank you, and contribute to the development of two repositories. This repository (osiset/laravel-shopify), and it's underlying API repository (osiset/basic-shopify-api).

Any sponsorship or donation will also add the individual's Github profile to this file as a thank you, unless the individual wishes to remain anonymous.

## How to Fund

Please see the `Sponsor` button at the top of this repository.

Currently `Github`, `Open Collective` and `Paypal.me` is supported.

+ You do not expect or put pressure on the developers to contribute daily
