----

This is a maintained version of the wonderful but now deprecated original [Laravel Shopify App](https://github.com/gnikyt/laravel-shopify/). To keep things clean, this has been detached from the original.

----

A full-featured Laravel package for aiding in Shopify App development, similar to `shopify_app` for Rails. Works for Laravel 8 and up.
